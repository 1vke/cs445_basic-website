		<h1>About Cyber Security</h1>
		<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
		<p>Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
		<h2>Core Pillars of Information Security</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Protecting information from unauthorized access and disclosure.</li>
			<li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that data is accurate, authentic, and has not been maliciously or accidentally altered.</li>
			<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that data and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Phishing:</strong> The practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources.</li>
			<li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malicious software designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid.</li>
			<li><strong>Malware:</strong> A type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer.</li>
			<li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> A tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
		<p>In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.</p>
		<h2>Best Practices</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Ensure your passwords are complex, unique, and changed regularly. Utilize a password manager when possible.</li>
			<li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring two or more verification methods.</li>
			<li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating systems, applications, and antivirus software to patch known vulnerabilities.</li>
			<li><strong>Backup Your Data:</strong> Frequently back up important files to an external hard drive or cloud storage to protect against data loss from ransomware or hardware failure.</li>
		</ul>
